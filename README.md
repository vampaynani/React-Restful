# RESTful barebone
## Getting started

The intention of this project is to provide the student with a simple base with which to start a RESTful project that serves its interests. 

This project is divided into two parts. The client and the server, the first one is developed in React and the second in Express. So to get started as soon as possible having the fundamentals of those two technologies is a must.

It must be taken into account that this is a very simple skeleton that serves as an example to make a connection between this two layes. Isolating responsibilities, configuration for deployment or databases connection is not considered for the purposes of this example.

To get started just enter from the terminal to each one of the directories(client and server) and run `npm start` (in each one of them).
